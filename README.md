## Description

The Purpose of this project was to show off the skills I have learned using HTML and CSS. The project gives a reader a taste of my personality as well as my hobbies. I did not know anything about HTML or CSS when I first started but I learned a lot. For example I learned how to implement sections and style them appropriately. Different sections of my project are currently slightly different than each other. This is because I added more things as I learned more. Another example is how each sections is meant for something else not the same thing twice. There is a section for a nav bar, for photos, for blogs. These helped me better understand how websites work and now I feel confident about using my skills on other websites. The first color scheme I had chosen was not exactly what I wanted and was a placeholder for the mean time. Now The colors of the website are different and have better contrast in order to make it easy to read.
