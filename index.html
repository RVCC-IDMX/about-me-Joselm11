            <h2>CSS animation</h2>

            <div>

                <p>To begin, using animations can be CPU intensive. You won’t have the same power on a full fledge PC as you do on a smart phone. There is a limit to how much animation you should use since it can take a lot of power to run. Not to mention the different types of animations and frames used should be limited. Furthermore, you shouldn’t make animations too long or too short in order to save time, cpu power, and make animations clean</p>
                
                <p>In the example of this animation you can see duration would be changing color from red to blue and the animation takes 4 seconds to complete. This can be shown with “animation-duration”</p>
               
                <p>The next part of animation would be how many times the animation runs. This can be useful to show an animation that move infinitely without having the user to repeatedly press it. This can be show with “animation-iteration-count”</p>

                <p>You are also able to have the animation move in normally or in reverse depending on what you are using. There are multiple ways to show this by using “animation-direction” from there the values you can use. One of the values is “normal” which plays as normal and is considered forward which is the default. You also have “reverse” which would play the animation backwards. There is also “alternate” which plays it forward and then backwards. Lastly, “alternate-reverse” plays the animation backwards then forwards. </p>
                
                <p>You can also set the speed of the animation which can be a very useful tool. The property “animation-timing-function” is the property we will be using for this animation. The values “linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out” all change the speed of the animation and even change the speed by sections. </p>

                <p>These animations can be combined to make something spectacular. The animation speed can be used when hovering over something to display that this is what you want to select. It is an easy way to verify to a user that it is what they are going to select. The same can be said for a link you select that turns purple after to let you know you visited it already. Animations are a great way to let users know something is being selected, turned on, and changed. Without different animations it would be difficult to navigate the web but thanks to animation we can make websites flashy and user-friendly. Not to mention, lots of websites use animation to make text come in and out. When scrolling down some websites have pictures, texts, and various other things. This can make a boring website full of text a little more exciting and engaging for users. Engaging users is a big part of creating a website because it keeps users coming back.</p>
                
                <p>Not every website needs outgoing animations. For example, amazon has very few animations if any when hovering over buttons. Meanwhile others have full on videos playing as a background. This really depends on the type of website you are building and who it is geared towards. Amazon is a very big online marketplace whereas corsair’s website has slideshows and videos playing. It really depends on your target audience. My website is focused more on showing off my skills as a web developer, almost like a resume.</p>
